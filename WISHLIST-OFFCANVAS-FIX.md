# Wishlist Off-Canvas Icon Size Fix

## Problem Description

The Wishlist Off-Canvas Settings "Icon Size" field in the WordPress Blocksy theme customizer had a critical bug where changes to the input value were not being detected by the customizer's change detection system. This prevented users from being able to publish/save their changes.

### Symptoms:
- Icon Size field changes were not detected by the customizer
- Publish button remained disabled when only the icon size was changed
- No live preview updates when changing the icon size
- Users couldn't save icon size changes

## Root Cause

The issue was that while the `wishlist_offcanvas_icon_size` field was properly configured with `'transport' => 'postMessage'` in the PHP customizer configuration, there was no corresponding JavaScript sync handler to:
1. Detect changes to the field
2. Enable live preview functionality
3. Trigger the customizer's change detection system

## Solution

Created a comprehensive fix that includes:

### 1. Main Sync Handler (`wishlist-offcanvas-sync.js`)
- Registers event handlers for the `wishlist_offcanvas_icon_size` field
- Provides real-time preview updates
- Ensures proper customizer change detection
- Handles responsive values (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Includes fallback mechanisms

### 2. Blocksy Integration (`wishlist-offcanvas-variables.js`)
- Integrates with Blocksy's customizer sync system
- Registers variable descriptors for proper CSS variable handling
- Follows Blocksy's established patterns for sync handlers

### 3. Script Enqueuing (`scripts.php`)
- Properly enqueues both sync files in the customizer preview
- Sets correct dependencies and loading order

## How to Test

1. **Open WordPress Customizer**
   - Navigate to `WooCommerce → General → Wishlist Settings`

2. **Configure Off-Canvas Mode**
   - Set "Display Mode" to "Off-Canvas"
   - Set "Icon Source" to "Custom configuration"

3. **Test Icon Size Changes**
   - Modify the "Icon Size" field
   - Verify the Publish button becomes enabled
   - Check that icon size updates in real-time preview
   - Save changes and verify they persist after reload

4. **Use Test Page** (Optional)
   - Open `test-wishlist-sync.html` in browser
   - Follow the detailed testing instructions
   - Use interactive buttons to test icon size changes

## Technical Details

### CSS Selectors Targeted
The fix targets these CSS selectors for wishlist icons:
```css
.ct-header-wishlist .ct-icon
.ct-wishlist-button .ct-icon
[data-id="wish-list"] .ct-icon
.ct-header .ct-wishlist .ct-icon
.ct-offcanvas-wishlist-trigger .ct-icon
```

### Responsive Handling
The fix properly handles responsive values:
- **Desktop**: Applied directly
- **Tablet**: Applied with `@media (max-width: 999px)`
- **Mobile**: Applied with `@media (max-width: 689px)`

### Integration Points
- Hooks into `customize_preview_init` action
- Integrates with Blocksy's `ct:customizer:sync:collect-variable-descriptors` event
- Uses WordPress customizer's `wp.customize()` API
- Follows Blocksy's established sync patterns

## Compatibility

- **WordPress**: 5.0+
- **Blocksy Theme**: All versions with wishlist functionality
- **Blocksy Companion Pro**: Required for wishlist features
- **Browsers**: All modern browsers with ES5+ support

## Troubleshooting

### If the fix doesn't work:

1. **Check JavaScript Console**
   - Look for errors in browser developer tools
   - Verify sync files are loading correctly

2. **Verify Configuration**
   - Ensure wishlist display mode is "off-canvas"
   - Confirm icon source is "custom configuration"
   - Check that Blocksy Companion Pro is active

3. **Clear Caches**
   - Browser cache
   - WordPress object cache
   - Any caching plugins

4. **Check File Permissions**
   - Ensure new JavaScript files are readable
   - Verify WordPress can access the files

### Debug Information

Enable WordPress debug mode and check for:
```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```

Look for any PHP errors related to script enqueuing in `/wp-content/debug.log`.

## Future Considerations

1. **Theme Updates**: This fix is in the child theme, so it won't be overwritten by parent theme updates.

2. **Plugin Updates**: Monitor Blocksy Companion Pro updates to see if this fix gets integrated upstream.

3. **Additional Fields**: The same pattern can be applied to other customizer fields that may have similar issues.
