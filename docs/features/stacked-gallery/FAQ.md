---

## General Questions

### Q1: Why use a child theme instead of modifying the parent theme?
**A:** Child themes allow you to:
- Preserve customizations when parent theme updates
- Safely override parent theme functionality
- Easily revert changes by deactivating child theme
- Follow WordPress best practices

### Q2: Will this modification break when Blocksy updates?
**A:** No, as long as:
- You only modify child theme files (never parent theme)
- Blocksy doesn't drastically change its gallery structure
- You test after each Blocksy update

### Q3: Can I use this with other WooCommerce themes?
**A:** Not directly. This is specifically designed for Blocksy theme. Other themes would require:
- Different CSS selectors
- Different JavaScript hooks
- Different PHP filters
- Custom implementation based on that theme's structure

### Q4: Do I need coding knowledge to implement this?
**A:** Basic knowledge required:
- **Minimal**: Copy-paste from `IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLE.md`
- **Recommended**: Understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP

## Technical Questions

### Q5: Why is the breakpoint 1024px?
**A:** 
- Standard tablet landscape width
- Matches common responsive design patterns
- Provides enough space for thumbnails + images
- Can be customized if needed (see customization section)

### Q6: Why load JavaScript in header instead of footer?
**A:**
- Must run BEFORE parent theme's Flexy initialization
- Parent theme loads Flexy early
- Header loading ensures our script runs first
- Prevents Flexy from initializing on desktop

### Q7: Why use `!important` in CSS?
**A:**
- Parent theme has specific selectors
- Need to override slider transforms
- Ensures stacked layout takes precedence
- Alternative: Use even higher specificity (longer selectors)

### Q8: Can I remove the `!important` flags?
**A:** Yes, but you'll need to:
- Increase CSS specificity
- Use longer, more specific selectors
- Test thoroughly to ensure overrides work
- Example: `.ct-has-stacked-gallery.single-product .woocommerce-product-gallery.thumbs-left .flexy-items`

### Q9: Why is thumbnail width 120px?
**A:**
- Provides good visibility
- Doesn't take too much horizontal space
- Matches common e-commerce patterns
- Can be customized (see `IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLE.md`)

### Q10: Why is the scroll offset 100px?
**A:**
- Provides breathing room from top
- Accounts for potential sticky headers
- Ensures image is clearly visible
- Can be customized in JavaScript CONFIG

}
```

### Q18: Can thumbnails be horizontal on desktop?
**A:** Not recommended because:
