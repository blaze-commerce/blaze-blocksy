# Wishlist Off-Canvas Clickability Fix

## Problem Description

The wishlist off-canvas container (`ct-offcanvas-wishlist`) had a critical clickability issue where all interactive elements inside the container were non-functional:

1. **Wishlist items** were not clickable (users couldn't interact with products)
2. **Sign-up button** for guest users was not responding to clicks
3. **Add to cart buttons** and other interactive elements were also affected

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by Blocksy theme's default CSS that sets `pointer-events: none` on all `.ct-panel` elements. The theme only enables `pointer-events: auto` when:

1. The body has the `data-panel*='in'` attribute
2. The panel has the `active` class

The wishlist off-canvas wasn't properly integrating with Blocksy's overlay system, causing the pointer events to remain disabled.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. CSS Fixes (`assets/css/wishlist-offcanvas.css`)

Added CSS rules with higher specificity to override Blocksy's pointer-events restrictions:

```css
/* CRITICAL FIX: Override Blocksy's pointer-events: none on panels */
#wishlist-offcanvas-panel.active {
    pointer-events: auto !important;
}

#wishlist-offcanvas-panel.active * {
    pointer-events: auto !important;
}

/* Ensure interactive elements within the off-canvas are clickable */
#wishlist-offcanvas-panel .ct-offcanvas-wishlist a,
#wishlist-offcanvas-panel .ct-offcanvas-wishlist button,
#wishlist-offcanvas-panel .ct-offcanvas-wishlist input,
#wishlist-offcanvas-panel .ct-offcanvas-wishlist .button,
#wishlist-offcanvas-panel .ct-offcanvas-wishlist .ct-wishlist-remove,
#wishlist-offcanvas-panel .ct-toggle-close,
#wishlist-offcanvas-panel .wishlist-item,
#wishlist-offcanvas-panel .recommendation-item {
    pointer-events: auto !important;
}
```

### 2. JavaScript Fixes (`assets/js/wishlist-offcanvas.js`)

#### Enhanced `openWishlistOffCanvas()` Function
- Added fallback check to ensure pointer events work after Blocksy's system activates
- Added timeout to verify panel activation and force pointer events if needed

#### New `ensurePanelIsClickable()` Function
- Forces the panel to be active and clickable
- Ensures pointer events are enabled on the panel and all interactive child elements
- Provides comprehensive coverage for all interactive selectors

#### Content Refresh Fix
- Added pointer events check when AJAX content is refreshed
- Ensures new content remains clickable after updates

#### Enhanced Event Handlers
- Added specific handlers for sign-up buttons and product links
- Improved debugging with console logs

### 3. Testing Infrastructure

#### Test Script (`assets/js/wishlist-offcanvas-test.js`)
- Comprehensive testing utilities for verifying clickability
- Automatic testing when panel becomes active
- Manual testing functions available in browser console
- Only loaded in development mode (when `WP_DEBUG` is enabled)

## How to Test the Fix

### Automatic Testing (Development Mode)
When `WP_DEBUG` is enabled, the test script automatically runs when the wishlist off-canvas is opened. Check the browser console for test results.

### Manual Testing
1. Open the wishlist off-canvas
2. In browser console, run: `wishlistOffCanvasTest.runAllTests()`
3. Check the test results for any remaining issues

### Visual Testing
1. **Open wishlist off-canvas** - Should open without issues
2. **Click on wishlist items** - Should navigate to product pages
3. **Click sign-up button** (when logged out) - Should work properly
4. **Click add to cart buttons** - Should add products to cart
5. **Click remove buttons** - Should remove items from wishlist
6. **Click close button** - Should close the off-canvas

## Files Modified

1. `themes/blocksy-child/assets/css/wishlist-offcanvas.css` - CSS fixes
2. `themes/blocksy-child/assets/js/wishlist-offcanvas.js` - JavaScript fixes
3. `themes/blocksy-child/includes/customization/wishlist/wishlist.php` - Test script enqueuing
4. `themes/blocksy-child/assets/js/wishlist-offcanvas-test.js` - Testing utilities (new file)

## Compatibility

- ✅ **Maintains existing visual appearance**
- ✅ **Compatible with Blocksy's overlay system**
- ✅ **Fallback support when Blocksy system fails**
- ✅ **WordPress coding standards compliant**
- ✅ **No breaking changes to existing functionality**

## Technical Notes

- The fix uses `!important` declarations to override Blocksy's CSS with higher specificity
- JavaScript fallbacks ensure the fix works regardless of Blocksy's overlay system state
- Test script only loads in development mode to avoid production overhead
- All changes are contained within the child theme directory

## Future Maintenance

- Monitor Blocksy theme updates for changes to the overlay system
- Test the fix after any Blocksy or WooCommerce updates
- Consider removing `!important` declarations if Blocksy provides better integration hooks
