## ü§ñ Automated Organization

This documentation is automatically organized using our intelligent categorization system:

### How It Works
1. **Automatic Detection**: New `.md` files are automatically detected
2. **Smart Categorization**: Files are categorized based on filename patterns and content analysis
3. **Git Hook Integration**: Organization happens automatically during commits
4. **Manual Override**: Custom categorization rules can be configured

### Usage Commands

```bash
# Organize all markdown files
npm run docs:organize

# Preview organization without moving files
npm run docs:organize:dry-run

# Show help and options
npm run docs:organize:help
```

### Protected Files
The following files remain in the repository root:
- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `LICENSE.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

## üîß Configuration

The organization system can be customized via `.docs-organization-config.json`:

```json
{
  "manualCategorization": {
    "development": ["custom-workflow.md"],
    "features": ["new-feature.md"]
  },
  "rootExceptions": ["CUSTOM-ROOT-FILE.md"],
  "skipFiles": ["temp/draft.md"]
}
```

## üìù Contributing to Documentation

1. **Create Documentation**: Write `.md` files anywhere in the repository
2. **Automatic Organization**: Files are automatically categorized and moved
3. **Manual Categorization**: Add specific files to `.docs-organization-config.json` if needed
4. **Review and Commit**: The system integrates with our Git workflow

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Include proper headings and structure
- Add relevant keywords for better categorization
- Follow markdown best practices
